# GroceryPrice-Comparer
Checks the Grocery Prices and gives best places to buy them 
The base idea is that as a broke university student / recent graduate, one goes to multiple stores to check for best prices before buying even a single item, this is tiring and tedious. So what this application will do is check which ones are available, in stock where and check the best prices. Also will check which grocery stores are near a person per location and make the list automatically for you!
